# MasksDown
Mobile App that gives the user information about the proper disposal of masks

# Inspiration
We got inspired by a hackathon project that we found named: Protect-21. This project created an app that would remind the user to use their facemask before going out. 
We realized that many people are not aware how of properly dispose of their masks after use, so we decided to create a mobile App that would help users be more informed.
